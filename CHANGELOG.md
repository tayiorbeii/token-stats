# Changelog

All notable changes to ccstat will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `ccstat all` command — aggregate usage across all providers (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Amp, Pi) into a single unified report
- Per-model cost breakdown in monthly output showing each model's tokens and cost sorted by cost descending
- `Provider::All` and `Command::All` CLI variants for multi-provider orchestration
- `ModelCostBreakdown` struct for per-model cost tracking in `DailyAccumulator`/`MonthlyAccumulator`
- README Pricing & Cost Estimates section documenting LiteLLM data source and caveats

### Changed
- Codex provider now walks session directories recursively (removed `max_depth(1)`) to discover files in YYYY/MM/DD subdirectories
- Cost mode enum simplified: removed `Fetch`, `Offline`, `None` variants (kept `Auto`, `Calculate`, `Display`)
- Updated embedded pricing.json to latest LiteLLM snapshot

### Fixed
- Codex model detection now reads from `payload.model` in `turn_context` events (the real model field), falling back to top-level `model_id` for older session formats

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Ctrl+C could not terminate `blocks --watch --active` (or `watch` command) — `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()` was recreated inside `select!` each iteration, causing the signal handler to be dropped and SIGINT to be silently swallowed

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Handle unknown models gracefully in Auto cost mode — unknown models (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-high`) now return $0.00 cost with a warning instead of causing a fatal error
- Deduplicate unknown model warnings to once per model name instead of once per JSONL entry

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Weekly report**: New `weekly` command for weekly usage aggregation
  - Configurable week start day via `--start-of-week` (default: sunday)
  - Table and JSON output formats
  - Live monitoring support with `--watch`
- **Codex provider**: Parse usage from `~/.codex/sessions/*.jsonl` with cumulative-to-delta token conversion
- **OpenCode provider**: Parse per-message JSON files from `~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message/*.json` with deduplication
- **Amp provider**: Parse Amp thread JSON from `~/.local/share/amp/threads/T-*.json` with usageLedger cross-reference for cache breakdown
- **Pi provider**: Parse Pi session JSONL from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` with `[pi]` model prefix
- **Multi-provider dispatch**: All report commands (daily, monthly, weekly, session) work with all providers

### Changed
- MCP stub error message now includes issue tracker link

### Fixed
- Missing `WeeklyUsage` import in `OutputFormatter` doctest
- CI workflow now triggers on `crates/**` path changes

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Restructured into multi-crate Cargo workspace (ccstat-core, ccstat-pricing, ccstat-terminal, ccstat-provider-claude, ccstat-provider-codex, ccstat-provider-opencode, ccstat-provider-amp, ccstat-provider-pi, ccstat-mcp)
- **BREAKING**: Two-level CLI structure with provider subcommands
- Updated Docker images and GitHub Actions to latest versions
- Updated Cargo dependencies to latest versions

### Fixed
- Resolved CI failures in workspace crate tests
- Fixed Docker Hub digests as source for GHCR manifest creation

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 model support with pricing data

### Fixed
- Merge online and embedded pricing data for complete model lookup coverage

## [0.3.3] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- **Watch Command Alias**: New `ccstat watch` command as a convenient shortcut for `ccstat blocks --watch --active`
  - Quick access to the live billing block monitor without typing the full command
  - Supports all global options like `--interval` and `--project`
- **Custom Cost Limits**: New `--max-cost` option for setting user-defined cost thresholds
  - Available on both `watch` and `blocks` commands
  - Allows users to set their own maximum cost for progress bar calculations
  - Example: `ccstat watch --max-cost 150` sets $150 as the maximum limit
  - Defaults to historical maximum if not specified
- **Enhanced Live Billing Block Monitor**: Visual ASCII art dashboard with real-time metrics
  - Progress bars for time elapsed, current usage, and cost projections
  - Burn rate indicator (NORMAL/ELEVATED) based on usage patterns
  - Status indicators (WITHIN LIMITS/APPROACHING LIMIT/OVER LIMIT)

### Changed
- Refactored main.rs to eliminate code duplication with new `handle_blocks_command` function
- LiveMonitor now supports user-defined maximum cost limits via `with_max_cost` method
- CLI structs now derive `Clone` trait for better command reusability

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for the new `watch` command
- Updated README with examples of custom cost limit usage
- Added visual output examples of the live billing block monitor

## [0.3.2] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- Properly count sessions in billing blocks
- Improve format_duration robustness and remove redundant output
- Handle negative session duration to prevent panic
- Correct gap block creation logic

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed
- **Blocks command date filtering**: Fixed issue where `ccstat blocks --since` and `--until` filters were not being applied
  - The blocks command now correctly filters billing blocks by date range
  - Both normal and watch modes now respect date filters
  - Example: `ccstat blocks --since 2025-08-14` now shows only blocks starting from that date

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- **Live Monitoring for All Commands**: Extended `--watch` functionality to all commands
  - `ccstat monthly --watch` - Monitor monthly aggregations in real-time
  - `ccstat session --watch` - Watch active sessions live
  - `ccstat blocks --watch` - Track billing blocks as they update
  - Works with all filters and options (e.g., `--watch --project my-project`)
- CommandType enum for flexible command-specific monitoring modes
- Enhanced LiveMonitor to support all aggregation types (daily, monthly, session, blocks)

### Fixed
- **Billing blocks --active flag regression**: Fixed issue where `ccstat blocks --active` would not show any active blocks
  - Corrected `is_active` logic in `create_billing_blocks` to properly check if a block is within its 5-hour window
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for active block detection

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Unified CLI options system - common options are now global
- **BREAKING**: Moved `--watch` and `--interval` flags from daily command to global level
- **BREAKING**: LiveMonitor::new() API signature changed to support all command types
- All common options (json, since, until, project, etc.) can be used at the global level
- Default to daily command when no subcommand is specified (`ccstat` = `ccstat daily`)
- Unified date parsing to accept both YYYY-MM-DD and YYYY-MM formats

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `--quiet` flag (quiet mode is now always the default)
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `--parallel` flag (parallel processing is always enabled)
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `load_usage_entries()` method from DataLoader
- Removed TimezoneArgs, ModelDisplayArgs, and PerformanceArgs structs (options moved to global)

### Improved
- Significantly reduced code duplication (~150+ lines removed)
- More intuitive CLI usage (e.g., `ccstat --json` instead of `ccstat daily --json`)
- Better user experience with unified options system
- Live monitoring now available for all report types, not just daily

## [0.2.2] - 2025-08-13

### Changed

  - Now matches the behavior in aggregation.rs::create_billing_blocks

## [0.1.5] - 2025-08-10

### Added
- New `statusline` command for Claude Code integration
  - Real-time usage monitoring for Claude Code status bar

  - Automatic local timezone detection (uses system timezone by default)
  - Timezone-aware date filtering and aggregation

### Fixed
- Daily usage now correctly shows today's data in timezones ahead of UTC
  - Previously, timestamps were always converted to UTC dates, causing "today's" usage to be grouped under "yesterday" in timezones ahead of UTC
  - Now respects the configured timezone when determining which day a usage entry belongs to

### Changed
- Date aggregation now uses local timezone by default instead of UTC
- All commands (daily, monthly, session, blocks) now support timezone configuration

## [0.1.3] - 2025-08-09
